<p>Finalized version of the codes can be included here.
  CWang: great idea. I would suggest to write some more detailed descripton of each code. For example, for the IPC code, please specify whether the agents are tracked or not. I remember some version like Caden's can track agents while Aakash's do not. It is good to have both of them here, but with some descriptions to differentiate these two. 
If you like, you could add some descriptions about your code.</p>
<p>siripc.m - related to the result of figure 1.</p>
<p>varpreF.m - related to the result of figure 2.</p>
